MC859/MO824 - Operational Research
==================================
Repo with every project from the MO824 course, consisting of Operational Research problems solved using optimization techniques such as
Linear or Integer Programming, metaheuristics and matheuristics.

Every report is in Portuguese, and some projects are entirely in Portuguese, such as the Final Project.
